**DeepGlobe Challenge 2018 Land Cover Classification Dataset** is a dataset for semantic segmentation tasks. It is used in the environmental, agriculture, livestock, and urban planning industries.

The dataset consists of 1146 images with 3042 labeled objects belonging to 7 different classes including *agriculture_land*, *urban_land*, *rangeland*, and other: *water*, *barren_land*, *forest_land*, and *unknown*.

Images in the DeepGlobe 2018 dataset have pixel-level semantic segmentation annotations. Due to the nature of the semantic segmentation task, it can be automatically transformed into an object detection (bounding boxes for every object) task. There are 343 (30% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 3 splits in the dataset: *test* (172 images), *train* (803 images), and *valid* (171 images). The dataset was released in 2018 by the [DeepGlobe Satellite Challenge (CVPR 2018)](http://deepglobe.org/).
