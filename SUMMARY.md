**DeepGlobe Land Cover Classification Dataset 2018 Challenge** is a dataset for a semantic segmentation task. It is used in the urban planning and environmental research. Possible applications of the dataset could be in the agricultural industry. 

The dataset consists of 1146 images with 3042 labeled objects belonging to 7 different classes including *agriculture_land*, *urban_land*, *rangeland*, and other: *water*, *barren_land*, *forest_land*, and *unknown*.

Images in the DeepGlobe Land Cover 2018 dataset have pixel-level semantic segmentation annotations. There are 343 (30% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 3 splits in the dataset: *train* (803 images), *test* (172 images), and *valid* (171 images). The dataset was released in 2018 by the <span style="font-weight: 600; color: grey; border-bottom: 1px dashed #d3d3d3;">DeepGlobe Satellite Challenge (CVPR 2018)</span>.

Here are the visualized examples for the classes:
